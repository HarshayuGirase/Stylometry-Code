# Stylometry
Scripts from the project I worked on under Professor Ben Zhao during RMP. Worked with Veena Chandran (undergrad) and Bolun Wang (PhD) to help identify infiltrated financial databases with ghost authors. Found sybil identities by learning and analyzing authors' language using Stylometry (linguistic/syntactic ML algorithm).
